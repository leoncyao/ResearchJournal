I want to share a particular kind of tangle which I thought has a cool correspondence with rational numbers. 

This post will be regurgitating the video series given by <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLL0ATV5XYF8BfT8CmmzKnfTlf3V9hQgj9">Matthew Salomone</a  >. I highly recommend you check out this series if you have a background in topology or group theory, and you are interested in knot theory. 

A tangle is a diagram of a small part of a knot. One way to construct tangles to draw a circle on the knot diagram such that the knot intersects the circle at exactly 4 places. Here is an example of a knot diagram.

Here is an example of a tangle.

One particular type of tangle is called a rational tangle. We construct rational tangles in the following way

Here is an example of a rational tangle (again all of these were drawn by Matthew Solomone).

The main is reason I feel this is a cool construction because of the way we can represent these tangle diagrams as rational numbers. 

As we construct these tangles with R and T operations, it is clear that each sequence of letters of R, T determines a tangle. For example, the sequence TTTTTRTTRTT produces the tangle in the previous example, as seen here.

Now you might wonder why we call these rational tangles. We will first note that the R operations have inverses. You can verify that R^-1 = R^3 geometrically. 
The proof that T^-1 = RTRTR can be seen with this gif.

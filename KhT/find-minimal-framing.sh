# goal, find the number integer describing number of twists to do to tangle, such that the tail of 
# the arc invariant chain complex dissapears

# first calculate chain complex with no twists, see how many black dots "n" at the end of the complex
# (this is mainly to check my work)
# for i in range(-10, 10):
#   calculate chain complex for tangle with i twists at bottom
#   check that the number of blacks dots becomes 0
